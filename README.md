# Setup

```
chmod +x dotfiles/install.sh
cd ~/dotfiles
# If you put `dotfiles` outside of $HOME, edit the $DOTPATH in `install.sh`.
./install.sh # don't execute as root (sudo)
```

Oh-my-zsh may replace .zshrc with .zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh. Fix it.

## Font

* powerlevel10k uses Nerd font. I recommend 'Meslo Nerd Font'. Run the following command and install it.

``` bash
curl -fLo "Meslo Nerd Font.ttf" https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/Meslo/M/Regular/complete/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf
```
